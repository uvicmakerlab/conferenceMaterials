# Motivations 

* In 2006, Environment Canada released a report saying that (as of 1 November 2005) 500,000 kilograms of waste containing hazardous materials had been seized. The waste was to be illegally shipped from the Port of Vancouver and sent to China. 
* In 2008, BC Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs collected over 14,000 tonnes of end-of-life electronics.  
* Electronics often contain lead, mercury, cadmium fire-retardant chemicals, chlorinated solvents, polyvinyl chloride, heavy metals, plastics, and gases.
* A longer history of planned obsolescence (which, as a term/concept, dates back to at least 1932) is also at work in practices like "sunsetting" software and the articulation of technology life cycles.  
* Of course, the reduction of e-waste and the production of green, lightweight technologies is also an industry: companies are now profiting from the existence and proliferation of e-trash. 
* For many technology- and media-based projects, materials can be sourced from ostensibly dead or obsolete electronics, cutting back on costs in an age of austerity and encourage post-consumer methods/approaches.   
* The use of local, dead technologies can decrease distribution costs and related emissions.  
* Learning about dead technologies (especially hands-on) can facilitate awareness about the sourcing, design, production, and circulate of electronics, including how to construct projects with minimal harm to the environment.  
* That learning can also spark an interest in the cultural histories of dead technologies and media, not unlike ongoing work in media archaeology (even if, in some cases, media archaeology practitioners resist or are even hostile to methods in cultural history).  
* Working with dead technologies also corresponds with a broader interest (in digital humanities, media studies, and elsewhere) in the material particulars of platforms, which cannot be reduced to concepts, metaphors, or what we engage via screens alone.  

# Questions

* In fields like digital humanities and media studies, do we have a model for something like an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)? If not, what should it entail? 
* How (if at all) does cloud computing affect our perceptions of e-waste and its production? Could it reduce e-waste? Could it increase it? 
* How is the proliferation of tablets and mobile devices influencing the perception and production of e-waste? 

# Some Creative + Critical Approaches 

* Developing partnerships between DH initiatives/groups and surplus facilities on their campuses 
* Community "challenges" to repurpose dead media / technologies  
* NSERC applications (how do they address waste; what are eligible expenses) 
* Environmental law (investigating histories of waste regulation)
