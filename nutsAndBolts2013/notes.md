# Motivations 

* In 2006, Environment Canada released a report saying that (as of 1 November 2005) 500,000 kilograms of waste containing hazardous materials had been seized. The waste was to be illegally shipped from the Port of Vancouver and sent to China. 
* In 2008, BC Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs collected over 14,000 tonnes of end-of-life electronics.  
* Electronics often contain lead, mercury, cadmium fire-retardant chemicals, chlorinated solvents, polyvinyl chloride, heavy metals, plastics, and gases.
* The use of local, dead technologies can decrease distribution costs and related emissions.  
* The reduction of e-waste and the production of green, lightweight technologies is also an industry: companies are now profiting from the existence and proliferation of e-trash. 
* For many technology- and media-based projects, materials can be sourced from ostensibly dead or obsolete electronics, cutting back on costs in an age of austerity and encourage post-consumer methods/approaches.   
* Learning about dead technologies (especially hands-on) can facilitate awareness about the sourcing, design, production, and circulate of electronics, including how to construct projects with minimal harm to the environment.  
* That learning can also spark an interest in the cultural histories of dead technologies and media, not unlike ongoing work in media archaeology (even if, in some cases, media archaeology practitioners resist or are even hostile to methods in cultural history).  

* A longer history of planned obsolescence (which ... ) is now at work in practices like "sunsetting" software and the articulation of technology life cycles.  

# Questions

* In fields like digital humanities and media studies, do we have a model for something like an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)? If not, what should it entail? 
* How (if at all) does cloud computing affect our perceptions of e-waste and its production? Could it reduce e-waste? Could it increase it? 
* How is the proliferation of tablets and mobile devices influencing the perception and production of e-waste?
