 <h1>8 | Findings I</h1> 
 
Sample Workflow: 

<p>Currently, there is no established workflow for fabrication research in digital humanities contexts, including those that focus on the creation, preservation, exhibition, and delivery of cultural heritage materials. Thus, the first and perhaps most obvious finding is that such a workflow needs to be articulated, tested in several contexts, and shared with the community. At this time, that workflow involves the following procedure:</p> 
<ul>
<li>1) Use an SLR camera and a turntable to take at least twenty photographs of a stationary object. This process should be conducted in consultation with GLAM professionals, either on or off site.  </li>
<li>2) Use software (e.g., 3D Catch) to convert the images into a 3D scale model.</li>
<li>3) In consultation with GLAM professionals and domain experts, error-correct the model using appropriate software (e.g., Blender). What constitutes an “error” should be concretely defined and documented. </li>
<li>4) Output the model as an STL file.</li>
<li>5) Use printing software (e.g., ReplicatorG) to process STL into G-code.</li>
<li>6) Send G-code to a 3D printer for fabrication.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the object is part of an interactive exhibit of cultural heritage materials, then:</p> 
<ul>
<li>7) Integrate the fabricated object into a circuit using appropriate sensors (e.g., touch and light), actuators (e.g., diodes and speakers), and shields (e.g., wifi and ethernet).</li>
<li>8) Write a sketch (e.g., in Processing) to execute intelligent behaviors through the circuit.</li>
<li>9) Test the build and document its behavior. </li>
<li>10) Refine the build for repeated interaction.</li>
<li>11) Use milling and laser-cutting techniques to enhance interaction through customized materials</li>
</ul>
<p>If the object and/or materials for the exhibit are being published online, then: </p>
<ul>
<li>12) Consult with GLAM professionals and domain experts to address intellectual property, storage, and attribution issues, including whether the object can be published in whole or in part. </li>
<li>13) License all files appropriately, state whether derivatives are permitted, and provide adequate metadata (e.g., using Dublin Core).</li>
<li>14) Publish the STL file, G-code, circuit, sketch, documentation, and/or build process via a popular repository (e.g., at Thingiverse) and/or a GLAM/university domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>When milling or laser-cutting machines are used as the primary manufacturing devices instead of 3D printers (see step 6 above), the workflow is remarkably similar. </p>

 <h1>9 | Findings II</h1> 

<p>Infrastructure Needs</p>
<ul>
<li>involve libraries </li>
<li>extend John Unsworth’s (1999) premise of “the library as laboratory” into all GLAM institutions </li>
<li>need for makerspaces </li>
</ul>
<p>Also, need for:</p> 
<ul>
<li>training in digital/material convergence, with an emphasis on praxis and tacit knowledge production,</li>
<li>a combination of digital and analog technologies, including milling, 3D-printing, scanning, and laser-cutting machines, </li>
<li>a flexible infrastructure, which would be open-source and sustainable, </li>
<li>an active partnership with a GLAM institution, and</li>
<li>research focusing on the role of desktop fabrication in the digital economy, with special attention to the best practices identified below.</li>
</ul>

 <h1>10 | Findings III </h1>

Best Practices

Desktop fabrication, especially in the humanities, currently lacks articulated best practices in the following areas: 
<ul>
<li>attribution and licensing of cultural heritage materials in 3D, </li>
<li>sharing and modifying source code involving cultural heritage materials, </li>
<li>delivering and fabricating component parts of cultural heritage materials,</li>
<li>digitizing and error-correcting 3D models of cultural artifacts, and </li>
<li>developing and sustaining desktop fabrication infrastructure.</li>  
</ul>
