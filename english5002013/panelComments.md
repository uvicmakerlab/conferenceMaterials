# English 500 Panel (Erin Kelly's Seminar) 

11 October 2013, 3:30 pm (with Stephen Ross and Aaron Mauro) at UVic

## To you, what is digital humanities?

Blending technical competencies in computing with critical approaches to culture (broadly understood). Most digital humanities research is collaborative in character, with practitioners documenting, sharing, and versioning the iterative development of their projects. 

For example, see the [Maker Lab's GitHub repositories](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab) for a sense of how our projects unfold (often publicly) over time. Alongside this project development, we also conduct free workshops (frequently intended for graduate students) and circulate brief essays (via [maker.uvic.ca](http://maker.uvic.ca/)) on the status of our research. These essays articulate the questions, surprises, and curiosities we're unpacking at a given moment. 

Once a given project is polished and released, we author journal articles and book chapters on how our research contributes to digital humanities (in general) or an allied field (e.g., media studies, scholarly communication, or literary modernism). Here's [one example](http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/234/301), from *Digital Studies / Le champ num√©rique*. This article is based on research I conducted with Craig Dietrich and the Scalar team at USC.  

##What digital humanities project (or projects) are you currently working on?

I'm currently involved in a number of projects. Aside from the [Lab's various projects](http://maker.uvic.ca/projects/) and my [book project](http://www.jenterysayers.com/2011/dissertation/) with U. of Michigan P., among them are [the Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory](http://www.hastac.org/), [*Kairos* journal](http://www.technorhetoric.net/), [the Digital Rhetoric Collaborative](http://www.digitalrhetoriccollaborative.org/), [Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu/scalar/), [Implementing New Knowledge Environments](http://inke.ca/), and [the Modernist Versions Project](http://mvp.uvic.ca/).

In the lab, we have been spending a significant chunk of our time on the [Kits for Cultural History project](http://maker.uvic.ca/insight/), a four-year (2013-17) project supported by SSHRC, in collaboration with [William J. Turkel](http://williamjturkel.net/) at Western. The kits we are making help people learn more about the material particulars of media history, with an emphasis on mechanisms over concepts. Right now, we are building kits about "flash jewelry" and the early emergence of batteries (in the late 19th c.), phonographic sound (in the early 20th c.), and DIY videogames like Tennis for Two (from the mid 20th c.). Each kit will include scholarly essays on these historical mechanisms, aspects of historical visual and sonic culture (e.g., prints as well as TIFF/WAV files on SD cards), and physical components that will allow audiences to reconstruct historical experiments using physical computing and desktop fabrication materials in tandem with residual (or "obsolete") media. Also, we're designing the kits to correspond with the packaging trends and materials design of their specific historical moments. This is the kind of stuff you can't download or email.     

In short, we encouraging people to learn about media history hands-on, through tacit knowledge production, even if we know we'll never be able to perceive or engage technologies like people did during, say, the 1880s. It's a sort of applied [media archaeology](http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/digital-memory-and-the-archive). In so doing, we're collaborating with museums and libraries to work with their old media and technology collections. For more on the kits, check out some of our recent posts, by [Nina Belojevic](http://maker.uvic.ca/kit1/), [Katie McQueston](http://maker.uvic.ca/packaging/), and [Alex Christie](http://maker.uvic.ca/tennis/). We also made a ["Kits for Cultural History" poster](http://maker.uvic.ca/kitsposter/) for Congress 2013 at UVic.  

## How did you get started on your current digital humanities project (or projects)?

During the early stages of my graduate studies, one of my supervisors (who directs a humanities centre at the University of Washington) told me the work I was doing was called "digital humanities." And so I joined [HASTAC](http://www.hastac.org/), attended the [DHSI](http://dhsi.org/) a few times, and started collaborating with people at other universities. From there, I either was invited to existing projects (like INKE and the MVP) or sparked new ones, like Kits for Cultural History. Since starting at UVic in 2011, I've received a tremendous amount of support from my colleagues in English and elsewhere, especially from Ray Siemens and the Electronic Textual Cultures Laboratory. 

## What have you learned by working on this project (or projects) that you didn't expect?

I've learned A LOT. Here are a few things (among many, many others): 

* Collaboration is taught and learned. It doesn't simply happen.  
* From a humanities perspective, technologies and media are not simply concepts or symbols in fiction. 
* The intersections of literary history with media history afford a rich domain for research. Even today (in fields like modernist studies), there's a glaring lack of scholarship at this intersection. 
* When it comes to technologies, humanities students too often develop comptencies in computation outside the classroom, hence seminars like English 507 at UVic.  
* The humanities laboratory is where I like to spend most of my time. I'm at home there.  
* We don't need revolutionary, determinist rhetoric (e.g., "the Internet is changing how we communicate") for the digital humanities to matter. Digital humanities are merely one facet of the humanities; they aren't separate from or antagonistic to "traditional" humanities (whatever that means).  
* Conducting research about media and technologies is all the richer when you know more about their material particulars, or how they turn this into that.  
* We need to do a lot more work where technologies and social/cultural difference are concerned. Technologies frequently foster exclusion (e.g., through white privilege and masculine culture). But there's nothing inherent to technologies that means such exclusions are inevitable. In the humanities and elsewhere, we can change the norms that congeal in and around tech. For instance, groups like [#TransformDH](http://transformdh.org/) are actively engaging issues anchored in race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class. And the Maker Lab is guest-editing a special issue of *New American Notes Online* about digital humanities, public humanities, and social justice. It should be out in late 2013 / early 2014.  

## Can you offer an example of a noteworthy digital humanities project? What makes this project so interesting to you?

Where to start? Here's a list of recent projects (excluding what's already referenced above) that inspire me:

But, if I have to pick one project, then it would be Sharon Daniel's collaborations with Erik Loyer, including [Public Secrets](http://vectors.usc.edu/issues/4/publicsecrets/) and [Blood Sugar](http://vectorsjournal.org/issues/6/bloodsugar/). Such a smart, compelling, and publicly relevant use of new media. Really brilliant work.
