With the rise of networked communications and Web 2.0 environments, social knowledge creation is an increasingly relevant scholarly practice, offering new tools and techniques for the creation, publication, and dissemination of research. Amidst these trends, scholars (e.g., Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Cathy Davidson, and Dan Cohen) now routinely call for the reform of scholarly communication practices, often with an interest in translating existing social knowledge mechanisms (e.g., Twitter and Disqus) into dynamic forms of scholarly review and community-building. In response to these calls, our group of INKE researchers is—through a blend of game studies, platform studies, and interaction design methods—prototyping a plugin to extend the affordances of academic publication platforms (e.g., Open Journal Systems) for open, networked peer review.  
Detailing and examining the particulars of our prototype, this paper first assesses whether activities such as online commentary (e.g., on academic blogs) could and should act as credible, secondary scholarship. Next, it articulates how our prototype operates within existing (cyber)infrastructures and peer review protocols. In so doing, the paper attends to how our prototype can be embedded into established metrics and systems of blind peer review, without abandoning scholars’ well-established investments in either of them. Here, we not only construct the “openness” of open peer review on a spectrum (e.g., through degrees or levels of access). We also stress the important roles that both incentive and history play in the prototype, arguing for “peer review personas” that help scholars: 1) provide a diverse range of commentary on scholarly communications, 2) document and aggregate granular activity over time and across venues, 3) develop reputations in their domains of expertise as well as authority in their communities of practice, 4) perform the context-dependent identities that professional peer review demands, 5) collaborate (knowingly or not) with a collective of allied practitioners, and 6) assess the tendencies and biases of peer review in the aggregate. To this end, the prototype enacts strategies to transform individuated peer feedback into peer-to-peer networks for collective, scholarly review. A key question, then, is for whom and by whom these networks are designed and built, and to what effects on the social relations, communications, and representations of scholarly communities.
